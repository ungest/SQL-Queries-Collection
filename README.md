# SQL Queries Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my SQL Queries Repository. This repository is dedicated to documenting the SQL queries that address various data-related issues identified in the Water service project for a certain location. Each query is a testament to our commitment to data integrity, problem-solving, and actionable insights.

## Repository Structure
The queries are organized by the problem they solve. Below is a summary of the problems and the SQL solutions provided.

### Problem 1: Data Integrity Verification
- **Issue**: Discrepancies detected between reported water quality scores and auditor's findings.
- **Solution Query**: `verify_data_integrity.ipynb` - This notebook provides queries that cross-references water quality scores from multiple sources and flags discrepancies for review.

### Problem 2: Record Linkage
- **Issue**: Difficulties in linking audit reports with corresponding water source records.
- **Solution Query**: `link_audit_records.ipynb` - This notebook provides queries that Joins the auditor's report with existing water source records to ensure seamless integration.

### Problem 3: Employee Audit Trail
- **Issue**: Need to trace data entry back to employees to identify potential errors or misconduct.
- **Solution Query**: `trace_employee_entries.ipynb` - The notebook provides an audit trail for data entries made by employees, highlighting error-prone or suspicious activities.

### Problem 4: Discrepancy Analysis
- **Issue**: Identifying and analyzing patterns in data discrepancies.
- **Solution Query**: `analyze_discrepancies.ipynb` - The notebook shows queries that aggregates and compares discrepancies to identify potential patterns or systemic issues.

### Problem 5: Correlation of Errors and Statements
- **Issue**: Correlating the frequency of errors with qualitative statements from the field.
- **Solution Query**: `correlate_errors_statements.ipynb` - This notebook provides queries that correlates errors with auditor's field statements to investigate the context of data inaccuracies.
